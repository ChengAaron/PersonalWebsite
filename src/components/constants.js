List is feels mostly solved, however needs further testing to determine techs needed for current meta."},

Suffers from occasional bricking due to nature of deck. Cindi is a support card of all time however is held back since its not a prayer dragon. Hoping this deck will one day get a Vairina searcher that can grab directly from deck since it bricks not seeing overdress."},
    {deckName: "Messiah", decklog: "", writeup: "Very excited to play this deck again with the new tools it got in set 6. Lady Battler gives you 8 locking front row, allowing you to be a little more liberal with your resources and playing grade 2. Need to test new into soul effect front trigger to see viability in the deck and the viability of 7-8 front in trigger line up."},
