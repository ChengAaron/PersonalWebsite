List is feels mostly solved, however needs further testing to determine techs needed for current meta."},

Suffers from occasional bricking due to nature of deck. Cindi is a support card of all time however is held back since its not a prayer dragon. Hoping this deck will one day get a Vairina searcher that can grab directly from deck since it bricks not seeing overdress."},
    {deckName: "Messiah", decklog: "", writeup: "Very excited to play this deck again with the new tools it got in set 6. Lady Battler gives you 8 locking front row, allowing you to be a little more liberal with your resources and playing grade 2. Need to test new into soul effect front trigger to see viability in the deck and the viability of 7-8 front in trigger line up."},

The deck did not recieve many tools in the recent sets, with the newest additions coming from SD17 Doflamingo in the form of 4c bounce Law and 2k Buggy. Deck is reliant on controlling board early and snowballing momentum. However, the deck struggles against late game decks with high cost top end and struggles against black and yellow."}
